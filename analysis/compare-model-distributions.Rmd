## Color distributions by topic

The last thing we'll look at before presenting plots for the final model is the color distribution over each topic. This gives us a picture of what our color themes actually are! 

```{r setup, }
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
load_data(sample_data = FALSE)
```

```{r load-chunk}
knitr::read_chunk(here::here("code", "compare-models.R"))
```

## Color distributions over topics 

For these plots the distribution is represented by a weighted relevance score (the same that is used in the `[`LDAvis` package](http://www.kennyshirley.com/LDAvis/#topic=0&lambda=0.61&term=).
 
The beta $\beta$ matrix, gives the posterior distribution of words given a topic, $p(w|t)$. Relevance is computed
\[ \text{relevance}(w|t) = \lambda \cdot p(w|t) + (1-\lambda)\cdot \frac{p(w|t)}{p(w)}.
\]


```{r color-distribution}
```
## How many themes?

Even though our model scores might have leaned towards a model with fewere topics, we can see specific topics where adding more models separates themes that appear to be quite different. The firs two examples are of topic \# 2 from the 30 topic model which seems more coherent in the 40 topic model (the sencond plot). 


### Topic 2 from the 30 topic model

```{r  topic-waffle-2-2}
```

```{r topic-table-2-2}
```

### Topic 2 from the 40 topic model

```{r, topic-waffle-3-2}
```

```{r  topic-table-3-2}
```

One final plot from topic 32 that I looked questionable but seems to have grouped some related (if small) sets. 

```{r topic-waffle-3-32}
```

```{r topic-table-3-32}
```
