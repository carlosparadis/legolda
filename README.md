# Modeling Lego sets with topic models

Repository with code and analysis for modeling color themes in the Lego dataset with topic models.

This repository is structured as a hybrid package and `workflowr` project. Re-usable, documented functions are in the `R` folder, code for analyses is in the `code` folder and rmarkdown files are in the `analysis`file. The analysis output is [here](https://nateaff.github.io/legolda/). 

See the [about](https://nateaff.github.io/legolda/about.html) page for more details and caveats. The code and analysis folders also have readme files outlining the folder contents.

If installing from here doesn't work try the [Kaggle repo](https://www.kaggle.com/nateaff/finding-lego-color-themes-with-topic-models).
